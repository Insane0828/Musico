# Musico - Privacy Policy

### What data does "Musico" collect?

As there is not much functionality to the bot yet, we do not really need to store any actual data.
We only store one basic thing to make sure that everything functions properly.

| Collected Data | Usage & Purpose |
| :------------- | :----------: |
| Server IDs & Channel IDs | Keeping track of saved server settings and playlist, autoplay & 24/7 settings.
| User Ids & Command Name | Used to send crash-bug reports if the bot crashes while using any command! |

### Do we share our collected data with anyone ?

We do **NOT** share any of our user data, since we know how important privacy is for every one of us.

### I want to delete all my data, how am I able to do it ?

- You can simply kick the bot from your server & all the collected data will be automatically deleted in a few minutes.
- I want to know more about my data: For more info join our support server & contact the developer (Insane#0828 or CookieMe#0001).
